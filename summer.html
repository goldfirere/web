<div class="section">Summer Research Project Ideas</div>

<p><em>These ideas are meant for internal circulation only. Please do not
    post!</em></p>

<p>Below are several ideas I have for summer research projects. These are
  all implementation-oriented, as I think a hands-on project works best for
  the summer format. Does one
  interest you? Let's talk!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/scienceresearch/">Official program info</a></p>

<ul>
  <li><p><span class="projname">Merging GHC's term-level and type-level
      parsers</span>. Part of the work to add dependent types to Haskell is to
      take GHC's current term-level and type-level parsers and merge them
      together, into one parser to rule them all. This work would be a
      concrete step toward building dependent types in a practical
      language and would give you a great deal of experience working in
      a real-world programming language compiler.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Improving GHC's error messages</span>. Currently,
      type errors are produced at the convenience of GHC. These messages are static
      and very old-fashioned: there are no colors, no interactivity, and no good way
      for them to interact with an IDE. In addition, they are sometimes awfully hard
      to understand.</p>

    <p>This project would be to rewrite GHC's
      error-message-handling mechanism, with two goals:
      <ol><li>Make error messages <em>structured</em>, allowing for interactivity
	  (e.g., hiding parts of the message), fancy formatting, and IDE integration</li>
	<li>Improve the subjective quality of error messages, making use of the fancy
	  features you established in goal (1).</li></ol>
      There is a good deal of interest in getting this done in the Haskell community;
      successful work here would gain you a lot of love.</p>

    <p>Some background material:</p>
      <ul><li>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7BBCcIDXSg">talk</a>
	  on how <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a> structures
	  error messages, which I'd like to emulate.</li>
	<li>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdVqQUOvxSU">talk</a> on 
	  <em>type provenance</em> a technique which might make error messages
	  more understandable.</li>
	<li>Though much more theoretical, <a href="https://popl18.sigplan.org/event/obt-2018-explaining-type-errors">
	    this abstract</a> describes a potential way to re-imagine type errors
	  to make them more systematic.</li></ul>
  </li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Implementing GHC proposals</span>. In the course of my main
      research thrust of adding dependent types to GHC, I have made a number of proposals through
      GHC's official proposal process. This process is hosted on GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pulls">This list of active proposals</a> includes several of mine
      (under username `goldfirere`), any of which would make a suitable part (or whole)
      of a summer project.</p></li>
  
<li><p><span class="projname">Visible type patterns</span>.
	Some <a href="http://cs.brynmawr.edu/~rae/papers/2016/type-app/visible-type-app.pdf">
	recent work</a> has introduced type applications to Haskell. These
	type applications can be used only in expressions, never in patterns.
	Users are thus asking to extend the new feature to patterns, as
	tracked
	in <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/11350">this
	ticket</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/96">this
	proposal</a>. (Do also
	see <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/11638#comment:1">this
	comment</a>, which discusses some of the challenges.) This project
	would be to specify and implement the new feature, hopefully leading
	to a Haskell Symposium publication.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Mechanized proofs of Haskell libraries</span>.
      An <a href="https://deepspec.org/main">effort is underway</a> to formally
      prove the correctness of various aspects of the functional programming
      ecosystem. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09286">recent paper</a>
      presents a tool for translating Haskell code to Coq code. <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a>
      is a <em>proof assistant</em> that allows you to write a mathematically
      valid proof in computer code; your proof is checked by the Coq compiler.</p>

    <p>The summer work would be to take certain Haskell libraries, run them through
      the hs-to-coq translator, and then write the proofs of correctness. This would
      be a great first experience in verified programming, and I'm confident you
      would find bugs in real, published libraries that could then be corrected.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Improving GHC's pattern-match warnings</span>.
      GHC currently helpfully reports when a pattern is redundant, unreachable, or
      incomplete.
      This warning is essential for writing error-free code. (Some languages make it
      an error to write an incomplete pattern-match.) However, the check has
      <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=!closed&keywords=~PatternMatchWarnings">many
      deficiencies</a>. This project would be to work through this area of GHC
      and try to make this check better. This could be a great first
      experience in open-source development and would be a real contribution
      to the GHC community. Required background
      reading: <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/512439/1/icfp2015.pdf">the
      paper</a> that describes the pattern-match checker.</p></li>
  
</ul>
