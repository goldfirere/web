<div class="section">Weekly Video Series</div>

<p>Every week (often on Tuesdays), I post a new video to Tweag's <a href="https://youtube.com/c/tweag">YouTube page</a>.
  This page is a table of contents to these videos, updated regularly. The videos are linked in reverse
chronological order.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jul 28, 2021: More about Haskell's kinds, exploring <a href="https://youtu.be/Qy_yxVkO8no">two examples of types with fancy kinds</a>.</li>

  <li>Mar 30, 2021: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-qGGag3Mt8">IO monad</a> is really just a state monad, passing

<li>Mar 1, 2021: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53DnugEwLb0">The GHCi command <code>:type +d</code></a> allows you to default a type – very useful in instructional settings.</li>



<li>Feb 22, 2021: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNAqtKtkMPU">Using closed type families to simulate closed classes</a>. This video explores a folklore trick to using a closed type family to avoid overlapping instances.</li>

<li>Jan 25, 2021: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zglkdlK2zR8">Connecting linear types to dependent types via relevance</a>. Unlike most other videos, this one focuses on a research paper I co-authored (with Pritam Choudhury, Harley Eades, and Stephanie Weirich). It focuses more on the Haskell of the future than the Haskell of today, and includes a little Idris programming.</li>

    
<li>Jan 18, 2021: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKpPJV0hhCY">How whitespace works in Haskell</a>. This video is much more of an instructional one than many, demonstrating how whitespace-sensitive parsing works in Haskell.</li>

<li>Jan 4, 2021: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qH91bgFq8">Type families can get stuck on invisible arguments</a>, as this video shows. If you have a poly-kinded type family that isn’t reducing, you may want to look here.</li>

    
<li>Dec 28, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6z3Bnnh_iY">Break out of Template Haskell and into the type-checker</a>. This video demonstrates how a sneaky Template Haskell user can access the full type-checker context, though doing so is dangerous.</li>

    
<li>Dec 21, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgPkeXX0p20">Roles can break abstraction</a>, because an abstract type with a class-based invariant might still be coercible to a different type that will violate the invariant. The video shows how this can happen.</li>

    
<li>Dec 14, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB53g6cEBVc">Strict variables assignments are not bang patterns</a>, as this video shows.</li>

    
<li>Dec 7, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdne-Ch2000"><code>DeriveAnyClass</code> considered dangerous</a>. This video demonstrates why I do not recommend enabling the <code>DeriveAnyClass</code> extension by default.</li>

<li>Nov 16, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3mbGK2qoc8">Rewriting with loopy equalities</a> explores how we might use an assumption like <code>a ~ UnMaybe (Maybe a)</code> for rewriting, even though it looks like using that for rewriting will cause infinite regress.</li>
    
<li>Nov 9, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXtdd8e7CQQ">Non-confluence</a> in the solver means that type inference can be unpredictable. And yet this happens! It means we can write a program whose runtime behavior depends on the order of constraints written in a type.</li>

    
<li>Nov 2, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Da_Jjdbg50">A type inference challenge</a> around using constraints to implement “fake” type families. The trick to get the example accepted is to introduce an ordering constraint on how certain constraints are solved.</li>

    
<li>Oct 26, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5veKgGxXd4">How impredicative types and type families don’t mix</a>, demonstrating how GHC’s new Quick Look algorithm stumbles over type families sometimes.</li>

The video includes a brief introduction to some of the details of the constraint solver, around Givens, Wanteds, and Deriveds. You can watch how some of the magic happens in debugging GHC itself. (I forgot to make my font size big for this one – apologies!)</li>

    
<li>Oct 14, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFZXWoqviBo">Why we can’t yet eliminate <code>Proxy</code></a>. Briefly, because Haskell does not yet allow visible type application in lambda-expressions that might be used in higher-rank contexts.</li>

    
<li>Oct 14, 2020: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vqB0GELyfg">Hello, World!</a>, where I briefly introduce the video series.</li>
</ul>

<div class="subsection">Production notes</div>

<p>I record these videos using <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>, with very light editing in <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/">DaVinci Resolve</a>. Recording, editing, and posting often add up to take 30-40 minutes of time, much of which is spent waiting for rendering (and can be parallelized with other work). Time to prep for a video ranges from no time at all to maybe up to an hour, if there is some tangled code involved. The goal in production is expedience over a polished result, meaning we all get to enjoy more videos, at the cost of sometimes a few glitches. In particular, I’m aware that sound quality would be improved with a boom mic, but I can’t imagine restraining myself from moving around while making the videos – something tangible would be lost.</p>
<p>The upshot here is that you too can make such videos: my headset (Logitech G332, highly recommended) was under $50 (though I then graduated to a Shure MV7 at a higher price point), and the recurring time investment is quite low. (It took me maybe a day to learn enough about OBS and DaVinci Resolve, with credit to my Tweag colleague Steve Purcell for introducing me to DaVinci Resolve.) And making the videos is definitely fun.</p>
