<dt><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall14">CIS194</a>: Introduction to Haskell Programming (full instructor, Fall 2014)</dt>
<dd>This course, aimed at undergraduates with a small exposure to functional programming, covers Haskell.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis552/">CIS552</a>: Advanced Programming (TA, Fall 2013)</dt>
<dd>This course is aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduates. Students learn how to create well-crafted code in a function language (Haskell).
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis120/13sp/">CIS120</a>: Programming Languages and Techniques I (TA, Spring 2013)</dt>
<dd>This is the second semester introductory course for computer science majors.</dd>

</dl>

<div class="subsection">Harvard University</div>

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://www.cs50.net/">CS50</a>: Introduction to Computer Science I (TA in 2000, 2001; head TA in 2002)</dt>
<dd>When I taught it, this course was a bread-and-butter introductory course in computer
programming, taught in C (with some assembly language, too). It has since morphed into
something more amazing. I shared the position of head TA in my last year at Harvard,
overseeing a teaching staff of around 10 and helping professor <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~smith/">Michael D. Smith</a> plan the course.</dd>

<div class="section">Teaching-oriented service</div>

<ul>
  <li>I organized the Spring 2015 "Types and Programming Languages" (Pierce, 2002) reading group, with a mixed attendance of graduates and undergraduates. We completed roughly a chapter of the book per week, with lots of stimulating discussion.</li>
  <li>I was the 2013-14 Center for Teaching and Learning <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/ctl/programs_services/graduate_student_programs/graduate_fellows_program">Fellow</a> for Teaching
    Excellence for the CIS department.</li>
  <li>I co-advised (with Stephanie Weirich) an undergraduate Senior Design project completed by Tiernan Garsys, Tate Mandel, Lucas Pe&ntilde;a, and Noam Zilberstein. The subject was a formalization of System FC in Coq. Check out their <a href="https://github.com/zilberstein/system-fc-coq">repo</a>.</li>

  <li>I co-advised (with Stephanie Weirich) an independent study / summer research completed by undergrad Hamidhasan Ahmed about explicit type application in Haskell. The ideas we came up with will work their way into my dissertation.</li>

<div class="section">High-school-level courses</div>

<p><em>Note:</em> The links below starting with <em>On...</em> expand
to short diatribes distilled from my strong opinions about various
aspects of education. Read at your peril and feel free to debate
with me over email. I readily welcome informed opposing viewpoints.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Introduction to Java Programming (taught 24 times, 2003&ndash;2011)</dt>
<dd>This course focused on writing small games; students wrote
final projects at the end of the semester, often re-creating classics such as Breakout,
Asteroids, or Tetris.

<div class="note" title="Variations"><p>There were a number of variations on this theme
over the years. Most notable was my attempt to include more girls in the class following
guidelines to make computer science more practical. These versions (advertised to the
student body in advance) included applications to a variety of non-computer-science fields.
However, my experience is that the games-based courses were more successful for all
genders.</p></div></dd>

<dt>Advanced Placement Computer Science AB (taught 6 times, 2003&ndash;2009)</dt>
<dd>Taught in Java, this course covered object orientation and data structures &amp;
algorithms up to linked lists, binary trees, and quick sort. It prepared students
to take a national exam showing college-level proficiency in computer science</dd>

<dt>Advanced Placement Computer Science A (taught 3 times, 2008&ndash;2011)</dt>
<dd>Also taught in Java, this course covered object orientation and simple recursion.

<div class="note" title="On the transition from AB to A"><p>In 2009, the
<a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/">College Board</a> discontinued the AP Computer
Science AB exam. According to the released statistics, it was easy to infer that
the AB exam was not profitable due to low enrollment. I can guess why the AB
enrollment was lower than that of A: AB was a lot harder, containing twice as much
material. However, I found it aggravating&mdash;and still do&mdash;that the decision made
was to jettison the harder course instead of to work on ways to train teachers
better to cover the hard material. I did it for six years and it was hard to cover
everything, but it was most certainly possible. In my opinion, the material
that remained in the A course could hardly be called suitable for "advanced
placement". In each of my three years teaching A,
I finished covering the core material by around
Christmas and spent the rest of the year attacking other topics. This may have
been fun for teacher and student alike, but I see this change as another sign
of the "dumbing down" of education.</p></div></dd>

<dt>Web Programming (taught 3 times, 2006&ndash;2009)</dt>
<dd>This course covered basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. It did
not cover any visual design aspects of building web pages.</dd>

<dt>Digital Electronics (taught once, Spring 2011)</dt>
<dd>This covered the basics of digital electronic design, including logic gates,
flip-flops, adders, and timing circuits. I designed the course from scratch
and outfitted a lab with all the necessary components.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FIRST Lego League</a> (mentored 3 times, 2008&ndash;2010)</dt>
<dd>During the last two years, I was the director of the FLL program at my school.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/">FIRST Robotics Competition</a>
(mentored twice, 2009&ndash;2010)</dt>

<dt>Algebra II Honors (taught 3 times, 2009&ndash;2011)</dt>
<dd>
<div class="note" title="On high school algebra"><p>This course taught essentially
one skill, with the usual variations: how to solve for <em>x</em>. I enjoyed
teaching my highly skilled and hard-working students to perform this skill,
required by the school's curriculum and by the expectations of competitive
college-bound high school students.
However, I find the skill almost completely useless! <em><a
href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Computers</a> can perform
this skill better than humans</em>, so why do we spend so long teaching it?</p>

<p>I can think of a few arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to solve for <em>x</em> to perform basic calculations throughout
life, such as remodeling a home or balancing a budget.</li>
<li>We need to know how to solve for <em>x</em> so that we can program and
maintain the computers to do so.</li>
<li>Learning to solve for <em>x</em> builds skill in abstract symbol manipulation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are my responses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Absolutely. Note that I did say &quot;almost completely useless&quot;. To
me, all students should know how to solve linear equations for <em>x</em>. For
problems harder than that, students should know how to use
a <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">computer</a> to perform the task.</li>
<li>Absolutely. Learning to solve for <em>x</em> should remain as a college-level
course (or perhaps high school elective)
for those who wish to learn more. Note that we don't learn Newton's method
for finding square roots anymore and are happy to let computers do that task for
us.</li>
<li>Absolutely. Students need to be exposed to abstract symbol manipulation.
However, I'm sure we can find a more useful way to do this than solving for
<em>x</em>. For example, we could teach programming in a
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">referentially-transparent,
pure functional programming language</a>. I would even accept teaching using
an <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org/">untyped functional language</a> that
is otherwise well designed. As another example, we could teach students
how to write inductive proofs. (The <a href="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-calculus-course-description.pdf">official curriculum</a> for the two levels
of the AP Calculus course is mysteriously devoid of the words &quot;prove&quot;
and &quot;proof&quot;.)</li>
</ol>

<p>For more along these lines, see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/conrad_wolfram_teaching_kids_real_math_with_computers.html">Conrad Wolfram</a> tell the same story.</p>

<p>So, do I think any given school should just stop teaching how to solve
for <em>x</em>? Unfortunately, no, I don't. In today's American educational
system, students are best served by preparing them for the college entrance
exams and to meet the college entrance expectations. These include a solid
grounding in solving for <em>x</em>. It is regretfully
up to national educational leaders
to start the conversation of how to get from the current antiquated form of
math education
to a system that uses today's technologies to the fullest
to prepare students for tomorrow's
changing needs. When that starts, schools should jump right on board, but
until then, the best a school can do is to squeeze in as much real math
education around the required curriculum.</p>
</div></dd>

<dt>Multivariable Calculus (taught once, 2005&ndash;2006)</dt>

<dt>Functions, Statistics, &amp; Trigonometry (taught once, 2009&ndash;2010)</dt>
<dd>This course was a bridge from Algebra II to Precalculus or AP Statistics for
students who were not ready to go there directly. It covered elementary statistics,
a solid unit on trigonometry, and basic operations on functions.

<div class="note" title="On math requirements">
<p>Both schools that I worked for had Algebra II as the final required math course.
However, the college counselors often (rightly) insisted that students continue to
take math to improve their chances at college admission. I agree that Algebra II
does not finally answer all the questions a student should have to get a basic
understanding of numbers. But I think that a standard Precalculus course (or a bridge
course such as the one I taught) does an even worse job.</p>

<p>In my estimation, the vast majority of students who might wish to stop math
after Algebra II will not have highly quantitative or numerically analytical
careers. The abstract mathematics taught in Precalculus does not serve this population
well. I have quite a solid understanding of Precalculus concepts, yet the only
time I can recall using them outside of my work was to inform my brother
(a mechanical engineer) that the optimal setting on the shower knob was at &pi;
on the unit circle.</p>

<p>Yet, I have used a higher math skill routinely during my
adult life: the ability to reason about finances. This I learned from my
father and from an AP Economics teacher who wisely strayed from the curriculum.
Students who excel at math are likely able to figure most of the details out
on their own&mdash;the math isn't really that hard. However, the students
who need to be urged to continue past Algebra II might not be so lucky.</p>

<p><em>High schools should equip all students with the ability to make
informed financial decisions as adults.</em> This includes a basic understanding
of how the stock market works as well as major other investment and debt
vehicles. For example, a high school graduate should be able to figure out whether to
lease a car or take out a loan to buy one, based on current and expected income,
investments, and mortgage payments. By not teaching our students how to do this,
we are handicapping those
students whose parents can't teach them and perpetuating current inequity to the
next generation.</p>

<p>In sum, I would love to see courses such as the one I taught (an equivalent
of which exists at many schools whose offerings I've examined) become part of
history and a course teaching basic financial know-how become a part of the
future.</p>
