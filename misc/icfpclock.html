This is a simple clock or timer application that was written for use
at ICFP.  In principle, it should work with any web browser that can
handle embedded JavaScript.

The clock is intended to be run on a laptop or tablet that is easy
for the speaker (and, ideally, the session chair) to see during each
talk.  Be sure to disable power saving features and plug the display
device in to an outlet on the wall to ensure that the clock remains
visible throughout the talk.

The clock goes through several phases:

- During the initial part of each talk, the clock just displays the
approximate number of remaining minutes, starting at 18, which is the
total length of time that is allocated for every "regular" research
talk.

- Five and a half minutes before the end of the talk time, the color
will change to magenta and the clock will start displaying the
remaining seconds in addition to the minutes.

- At the end of the talk time, the clock will change to blue and will
continue counting down through "negative times".  The "Talk" label
will change to "Q&A", indicating that we are now in the Question and
Answer portion of the talk.

- After the allocated Q&A time (4 mins, 30 seconds), the clock will
change to red, continue counting down, and show a "STOP" label.  If
the talk and Q&A is not already completed by this point, then we have
fallen behind schedule.  In other words, our goal, as best we can, is
to avoid reaching this phase of the clock!

If you want to use the clock for practice, you might find it useful to
know that you can restart it by clicking on the countdown time at the
top of the screen (or on the "REGULAR" label at the bottom).
