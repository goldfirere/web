<div class="section">Short bio</div>

<p>Richard is a language designer and compiler engineer at Jane Street. His work
centers around how we can use static type systems to power
high-assurance programming and avoid programmer mistakes, all
  without sacrificing ease-of-use or runtime efficiency. Richard
  works with functional languages OCaml and Haskell, where he
  contributes both language design and compiler implementation.
  He additionally serves
as the chair of the board of the Haskell Foundation.
He lives in suburban Philadelphia with his wife and daughter.</p>

<div class="section">Bio</div>

<p>I grew up in Woodcliff Lake, NJ, about 20 miles from New York City. After sixth grade,
the local school's math curriculum wasn't working for me, and I was lucky enough to
be able to go to <a href="http://www.horacemann.org/">Horace Mann</a>, commuting every
day into NYC. Thanks in large part to the opportunities I found there (and, I believe,
because I started the successful Ski Club), I managed to get into
<a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>. Thanks to Advanced Placement credits
from high school (and the due share of hard work), I was able to convince Harvard
to give me two degrees upon my departure in 2003: a BA in Physics and an MS in Computer
Science.</p>

<p>I was at Harvard during (the end of) the dot-com boom. There weren't enough
graduate students to staff the undergraduate courses, so professors hired
undergrads to be TAs in other undergrad courses. I was a TA for the first
course in the CS majors' sequence (<a href="https://www.cs50.net/">cs50</a>)
from sophomore year on, acting as one of two head TAs in my senior year.
One night during my senior year, as I was
getting ready for bed, I found myself thinking that the day had been a great one.
Then, I realized
that the day had been entirely consumed by my duties as a head TA. Thus, I
decided to go into education full-time, and landed a job
at <a href="http://www.nmhschool.org/">Northfield Mount Hermon School</a>.</p>

<p>Northfield Mount Hermon is a co-educational boarding school set in rural
Franklin County in western Massachusetts. As is always the case of employees
at a boarding school, I fulfilled a number of roles, including computer
science teacher, math teacher, math team coach, SAT math prep course
instructor, and dorm parent. See my <a href="teaching.html">teaching</a> page
for more info. I lived in the freshman boys' dorm for all five years. During
my last two years, I was the House Director. Helping students day in and day
out adjust both to the rigors of high school and to living without their
parents was incredibly fulfilling. I still miss the warm, fun community that
was East Hall (for two years) and London Cottage (for three).</p>

<p>(Working at a boarding school is a great experience for an individual with the right
mind-set. I'd be happy to offer more thoughts on this, if you're interested. Just email!)</p>

<p>The community of a boarding school is fantastic, but it's a little isolating. So,
I thought I would try something completely different. I moved to London!
While there, I worked at <a href="http://www.asl.org/">The American School in London</a>.
Life outside of my job was very different living overseas, but my job responsibilities
remained remarkably unchanged. Again, see my <a href="teaching.html">teaching</a> page
for more detailed info.</p>

<p>Most notably, London is where I met my wonderful wife, Amanda, though she originally
hails from outside of Philadelphia. Our daughter, Emma, was born in London (and has dual
citizenship) in June of 2011. We moved back to the US when she was 5 weeks old. Having
a first child, moving internationally, buying a first house, and changing careers all at the same time was
difficult. I don't recommend it.</p>

<p>While working in London, two things happened: I found myself increasingly itching for
more intellectual stimulation, and I met a bunch of professors, all of whom said they had
the best job in the world. So, I left a career I loved (teaching high school really was
  fantastic) in search of one even better and enrolled in the doctorate program at the
  <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a>.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, being a graduate student was fun. I worked with an absolutely
  amazing advisor, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie Weirich</a>, and got
  to spend my days tinkering with types, proving properties, and hacking in Haskell. The
  flexibility of grad school meshed quite well with the inflexibility of raising a child, so
  timing was good. Penn is a great place for grad school. Go there.</p>

<p>Toward the end of my time at Penn, I landed my dream job at <a href="http://cs.brynmawr.edu">Bryn
    Mawr College</a>. I say it's my dream job because it's precisely what I was looking for when
  I started at Penn -- an even balance of teaching and research at a liberal arts college. Even better,
  my family and I could remain near extended family and I could easily continue the research collaborations
  and partnerships I built while at Penn, chiefly with Stephanie and her students.</p>

<p>After three great years at Bryn Mawr, I decided&mdash;much to my surprise&mdash;to leave academia.
  Essentially, I realized that I would not have the time as a professor to devote to my research goals.
  In particular, I feel I have something to contribute to <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, and I wouldn't quite be able
  to pull it off as a professor. With the implementation demands of a project like Haskell/<a href="http://haskell.org/ghc">GHC</a>,
  balancing teaching and research was too much. So I was thrilled to connect with <a href="https://tweag.io/">Tweag</a>, a
  software consultancy and research lab based in Paris, France. They hired me as a Principal Researcher to continue
  my type-systems research and my contributions to GHC. One of my
  major projects as part of my work at Tweag was to help launch the
  <a href="http://haskell.foundation/">Haskell Foundation</a>, where
  I serve as chair of the board.</p>

<p>Why concentrate on one language when I can have two? Three years
into my time at Tweag&emdash;and after roughly a decade focused on Haskell&emdash;I found I wanted to learn more about how
languages other than Haskell worked, both on a technical and social
level. I was thus very happy to land a job
at <a href="https://janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>, a leading
enterprise user of the <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>
language. At Jane Street, I take much of what I learned about Haskell
and apply it in a new setting, all while trying to increase the
transfer of knowledge between the two language communities. I continue
to show up for work every day excited about what problems I'll be able
to solve.</p>

  info about what I'm up to today.</p>
