<div class="section">I'm on the market!</div>
<p>I expect to graduate during the summer of 2016, and am currently looking for
a job to start in the fall of 2016. The focus of my search is strongly skewed
toward academia, but I am open to the possibility of an industry job if the fit
is just right.</p>

<p>My <a href="reisenberg-CV.pdf">CV</a>, <a href="misc/job/reisenberg-research.pdf">research
statement</a>, and <a href="misc/job/reisenberg-teaching.pdf">teaching
statement</a> are online.</p>

<div class="section">About Me</div>

<p>I am currently a PhD student focusing on programming languages in the Computer &amp;
Information Science department at the University of Pennsylvania. My advisor is
  <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie Weirich</a>, and I
  also work closely with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/">Simon Peyton Jones</a>.
  I started working toward my degree in 2011.</p>

<p>My research aims to reduce the occurrence of bugs in computer code through enhanced
static checks. I am interested in type systems and how they can help a programmer to avoid
logical fallacies and erroneous programs.
In particular, I believe that clever use of dependent types can encourage a programmer
to write only correct code. A long-term goal of mine is to bring dependent types to a
wider audience, both into industry and into education. On a more basic level,
I also love the formalisms and proofs involved in programming language research!</p>

<p>The current focus of my research is on playing with the
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> language and tinkering
with its primary compiler, <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>.
My immediate goal with GHC is to add dependent types to Haskell. See
<a href="papers/2015/thesis/eisenberg-thesis-proposal.pdf">my dissertation
proposal</a> for more details.</p>
