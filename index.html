<div class="section">About Me</div>

<p>I am a language designer and compiler engineer
  at <a href="http://janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>,
  where I work on improvements to
  the <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> functional programming
  language.
  In addition, Jane Street supports my work
  on <a href="https://haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and its primary
  compiler, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>. In both
  languages, my goal is to make these statically typed
  functional programming languages an excellent first choice of
  language for the implementation of efficient, enterprise systems.</p>

<p>My background is in functional programming and type systems
research.
My research aim is to reduce the occurrence of bugs in computer code through enhanced
static checks. I am interested in type systems and how they can help a programmer to avoid
logical fallacies and erroneous programs.
In particular, I believe that clever use of dependent types can encourage a programmer
to write only correct code. A long-term goal of mine is to bring dependent types to a
wider audience, both into industry and into education. On a more basic level,
I also love the formalisms and proofs involved in programming language
  research!</p>

<p>I completed my doctorate in 2016
  at the University of Pennsylvania; my thesis advisor was
  <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie Weirich</a>.</p>
