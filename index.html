<div class="section">About Me</div>

<p>I am currently a PhD student focusing on programming languages in the Computer &amp;
Information Science department at the University of Pennsylvania. My advisor is
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie Weirich</a>, and I enjoy working with the other
programming language professors, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/">Benjamin Pierce</a> and
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/">Steve Zdancewic</a>. I started working toward my degree in 2011.</p>

<p>My research aims to reduce the occurrence of bugs in computer code through enhanced
static checks. I am interested in type systems and how they can help a programmer to avoid
logical fallacies and erroneous programs.
In particular, I believe that clever use of dependent types can encourage a programmer
to write only correct code. A long-term goal of mine is to bring dependent types to a
wider audience, both into industry and into education. On a more basic level,
I also love the formalisms and proofs involved in programming language research!</p>

<p>The current focus of my research is on playing with the
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> language and tinkering
with its primary compiler, <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>. You can
see a list of my current and former projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>.
