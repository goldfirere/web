<div class="section">Starting in August 2016, I will be an Assistant Professor
  at <a href="http://cs.brynmawr.edu/">Bryn Mawr College</a>.</div>
<p>Bryn Mawr is a women's college in suburban Philadelphia, which shares a close
  partnership with the co-ed Haverford College, about 1 mile away. Students
  very frequently cross-register between the two colleges, and Haverford students
  (along with Swarthmore students, though Swarthmore is a bit further afield)
  are welcome to join my research group. I look forward to continuing to do
  research in type systems and functional programming in my new job, as well
  as teaching the next crop of computer scientists. If you're in high school,
  please consider joining one of these schools!

<div class="section">About Me</div>

<p>I am currently a PhD student focusing on programming languages in the Computer &amp;
Information Science department at the University of Pennsylvania. My advisor is
  <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie Weirich</a>, and I
  also work closely with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/">Simon Peyton Jones</a>.
  I started working toward my degree in 2011.</p>

<p>My research aims to reduce the occurrence of bugs in computer code through enhanced
static checks. I am interested in type systems and how they can help a programmer to avoid
logical fallacies and erroneous programs.
In particular, I believe that clever use of dependent types can encourage a programmer
to write only correct code. A long-term goal of mine is to bring dependent types to a
wider audience, both into industry and into education. On a more basic level,
I also love the formalisms and proofs involved in programming language research!</p>

<p>The current focus of my research is on playing with the
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> language and tinkering
with its primary compiler, <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>.
My immediate goal with GHC is to add dependent types to Haskell. See
<a href="papers/2015/thesis/eisenberg-thesis-proposal.pdf">my dissertation
proposal</a> for more details.</p>
