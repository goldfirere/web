<div class="section">About Me</div>

<p>I am a Principal Researcher at <a href="https://tweag.io/">Tweag I/O</a>.
  My research focus
  is on programming language theory and implementation, and I am a core contributor
  to the GHC Haskell compiler and ecosystem. I completed my doctorate in 2016
  at the University of Pennsylvania; my thesis advisor was
  <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie Weirich</a>.

<p>My research aims to reduce the occurrence of bugs in computer code through enhanced
static checks. I am interested in type systems and how they can help a programmer to avoid
logical fallacies and erroneous programs.
In particular, I believe that clever use of dependent types can encourage a programmer
to write only correct code. A long-term goal of mine is to bring dependent types to a
wider audience, both into industry and into education. On a more basic level,
I also love the formalisms and proofs involved in programming language research!</p>

<p>The current focus of my research is on playing with the
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> language and tinkering
with its primary compiler, <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>.
My immediate goal with GHC is to add dependent types to Haskell. See
<a href="papers/2016/thesis/eisenberg-thesis.pdf">my dissertation</a> for more details.</p>
