<div class="section">Project ideas</div>

<p><em>These ideas are meant for private circulation only. Please do not
post!</em></p>

<p>Below are several ideas I have for upcoming research projects. Are you
  interested in taking one of these on? Let's talk!</p>

<p>(If you don't have all the prerequisites yet for an idea you're excited
  about, don't fret. If we have enough time, we can cover the prerequisites on
  the way.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><span class="projname">Lightweight existentials</span>. Haskell
  supports
    <em>existential types</em>, allowing users to pack compile-time type-level
    information into a data structure. These are very useful when returning
    values in a richly typed environment, where the type index of the returned
    value cannot be computed. For example, if we wish to support refinement
    types (in the style
    of <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/">LiquidHaskell</a>),
    we need to make refined return types to be existential.</p>

    <p>However, current support for existentials is clunky. Each existential
      requires a separate datatype definition, and existential packing and
      unpacking require explicit pattern matches. Existentials also require an
      extra box at runtime, because
      <tt>newtype</tt>s cannot pack an existential variable. This is all very
      dissatisfying. Instead, existentials should be lightweight, both at
      compile time and at runtime. The question is, how?</p>

    <p>This is a major research project, probably spanning multiple years and
      producing hopefully a number of papers.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Type-level programming experience in Haskell,
      type theory including existential types, an understanding of Haskell's
      OutsideIn type inference algorithm (or other relevant type inference
      experience).</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Constrained dependent functions</span>.
      The <a href="https://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1075&context=compsci_pubs">
        Constrained Type Families</a> paper describes a way of requiring
      partial functions to be associated with class constraints. As that
      paper describes, doing this simplifies and improves the type system
      in a number of ways. However, how does this approach scale to a language
      with full dependent types and the possibility of case-matching in types?
    This project would explore that question and propose an answer.</p>
    
    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Experience with dependently typed programming,
      creativity and independence in coming up with an answer to the question --
      unlike most of the other projects here, I don't have a great idea of what
      the answer will really be!</p></li>
  
  <li><p><span class="projname">Termination checking for Haskell</span>.
      As Haskell's type system becomes more expressive, it is sometimes necessary
      to write <em>proofs</em> in programs. These proofs are then used, say, to
      show that two types are equivalent and therefore that some function
      should be accepted (when this is not otherwise apparent to the type checker).
      However, Haskell's current approach to proofs requires <em>running</em>
      the proofs, essentially just to check whether they terminate. Requiring
      a proof to run in a released program is terrible: it means that extra compile-time
      guarantees the author seeks must now be paid for by end users.</p>

    <p>This project would be to develop approaches to termination checking
      in Haskell. This is <em>challenging</em> because Haskell was not designed
      to be a total language. An early step might be listing ways that Haskell
      programs might diverge, and then choosing to tackle these in some order.</p>

    <p>There is significant prior work in this area, most notably <a href="http://goto.ucsd.edu/~nvazou/refinement_types_for_haskell.pdf">these</a> <a href="https://nikivazou.github.io/static/popl18/refinement-reflection.pdf">papers</a> (and others)
      about <a href="https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/">Liquid Haskell</a>.
      However, none of this work has been integrated into GHC, and these papers work over
      a slightly simplified version of Haskell.</p>

    <p>This may be a multi-year project (though perhaps nicely decomposable), hopefully
      leading to several publications.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Strong Haskell programming experience, experience programming
      in some total language, and a knowledge of programming language termination proofs.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><span class="projname">Term-level specialization</span>. When you write a polymorphic
      function in Haskell, you can direct the compiler to specialize it. For example,
      if we have <tt>plusTimes :: Num a => a -> a -> a -> a; plusTimes x y z = (x+y)*z</tt>,
      we can say <tt>{-# SPECIALIZE plusTimes :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int #-}</tt>. GHC
      will then create a new function <tt>$plusTimesInt</tt> that works only at type <tt>Int</tt>.
      With optimizations on, this means that the specialized function can perhaps inline
      the definitions of addition and multiplication, making it much faster than the general function.</p>

    <p>This project would be to allow such specialization for <em>terms</em>, not just types.
      For example, if we had <tt>foo a b c = if a then b else c</tt>, we might want specializations
      for <tt>foo True</tt> and <tt>foo False</tt>. Then, at call sites, GHC could detect whether
      we know the first argument to <tt>foo</tt> in advance; if so, just call the specialization.
      (GHC already knows how to do this last step -- it's the specialized function generation that
      is new.)</p>

    <p>Completing the project would require a design for the feature, an implementation, and a
      careful study (with lots of examples) of the benefits of this approach to real programs.
      Depending on how novel and powerful this idea turns out to be, this could lead to a nice
      publication.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Strong Haskell programming skills and experience with empirical
      analysis.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><span class="projname">Unboxed function closures</span>. When we define a local
      function in Haskell, that function is represented at runtime via a <em>closure</em>,
      a structure that contains both a pointer to the compiled code that executes the function
      and also to any data captured by the function (because it is stored in local variables in
      the function definition's environment). This closure structure is <em>boxed</em>, meaning
      it is allocated on the heap and contains at least two fields (one for code, and one for
      data).</p>

    <p>The key question here is: <em>Can we avoid the box?</em> That is, is it possible to
      create a function closure without allocating more memory? This might matter if, say,
      the closure is used in a tight loop. Every time around the loop, we have to perform
      a pointer access to get to the body of the closure. Also problematic is that a program
      that creates many closures will take up space storing all the closure objects.</p>

    <p>This project would study the effect of boxing closures has at runtime (both space and time)
      and try to invent a way to drop the box. Dropping the box would require using something
      like <em>unboxed tuples</em>, which are Haskell structures that store their information
      in multiple registers or stack slots, but without a runtime digest. One challenge with
      unboxed tuples is that they do not work well in polymorphic code, because the representation
      of an unboxed tuple depends on its size and the nature of its components. (Boxed things
      all have a uniform representation, making polymorphism easy.) See the <a href="http://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&context=compsci_pubs">Levity Polymorphism</a> paper for more details on the
      challenges.</p>

    <p>I would expect this project to produce a top conference paper.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Low-level systems knowledge (e.g. memory representations, caching, etc),
      data analysis experience, and Haskell programming experience.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><span class="projname">Introspective Template Haskell</span>. This
	  project idea is well described in
	  this <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/TemplateHaskell/Introspective">wiki
	  page</a>. In summary, the idea is to redesign Haskell's
	  metaprogramming facility to use GHC's internal structures, instead
	  of the current design of using a separate set of language
	  representation types. This work may lead to a paper publishable
	  at <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/"> Haskell
	  Symposium</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> A semester (or equivalent) of Haskell
      programming, and a knowledge of abstract syntax trees. Experience with
      macro systems is a plus.</p></li>
    
  <li><p><span class="projname">First-class patterns</span>. Haskell supports
      first-class functions, allowing us to abstract arbitrarily over
      functions and writing functions on functions. With
      its <a href="papers/2016/patsyns/pattern-synonyms.pdf">Pattern
      Synonyms</a> feature, Haskell also supports user-defined pattern
      synonyms, allowing some level of abstraction over patterns. But these
      pattern synonyms are not first-class: they must be at top-level, and
      there is no way to bind a variable to be a pattern. This significant
      reseach project would explore the utility and techniques to design a
      programming language with first-class patterns, allowing arbitrary
      pattern abstraction.</p>

    <p>I would expect that a full treatment of this topic would lead to a
    strong ICFP submission.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> A semester of programming in a typed functional
      language and knowledge of type theory.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">An analysis of GHC's solver</span>. GHC uses
      an intricate algorithm in order to prove the typability (or lack
      thereof) of Haskell programs. The last textual description of this
      solver was
      in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jfp-outsidein.pdf">2010</a>,
      and it is now sorely out-of-date. This work would be to analyze the
      current solver, describe the algorithm, and prove that it is
      terminating. It is quite likely <em>not</em> currently a terminating
      algorithm, so part of the work would be repairing it.</p>

    <p>This work, if done well, should lead to either an ICFP publication or
      perhaps a Journal of Functional Programming article.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Strong Haskell programming skills, as well as
      experience in algorithm analysis and termination proofs.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Eliminating <tt>TypeRep</tt></span>.
      Currently, GHC has a type <tt>TypeRep</tt> which serves as a runtime
      type representation.
      <tt>TypeRep</tt> is most recently
      described <a href="/papers/2016/dynamic/dynamic.pdf">here</a>.
      However, GHC has a perfectly good type that should do this
      already: <tt>Type</tt> (a.k.a. <tt>*</tt>). The problem is
      that <tt>Type</tt> is at the type level and <tt>TypeRep</tt> is at the
      term level.</p>

    <p>This project would be to implement a treatment of <tt>Type</tt> at the
      term level, supplanting <tt>TypeRep</tt>. It is unclear what the
      ramifications of this idea are, and where the discoveries might
      lead.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Excellent Haskell programming skills, and a
      delight in tinkering with type system esoterica.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Semantics for type families</span>. Haskell
      supports <em>type families</em>, which are essentially functions on
      types. But GHC gives no precise semantics for how these behave. This
      project would be to design a semantics (preferably, lazy semantics that
      mirrors term-level behavior) and implement these, demonstrating that the
      semantics can be implemented efficiently.</p>

    <p>This project is likely quite a bit subtler than it seems, possibly
      leading to several publications.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Excellent Haskell programming skills, and
      experience with type theory and operational semantics.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Type inference for generalized algebraic
      datatypes</span>. The state-of-the-art in practical GADT type inference
      still appears to
      be <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jfp-outsidein.pdf">OutsideIn</a>.
      This paper describes GHC's type inference algorithm, and it sets out a
      specification for this algorithm. However, the implementation does not
      quite meet the specification (see Section 6.3 of that paper). The goal
      of this project would be to come up with a way to phrase GADT type
      inference that leads to an implementable specification.</p>

    <p>A proper job here would lead to a very strong publication, probably for
    POPL.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Comfort programming with GADTs (preferably in
      Haskell, but Agda / Idris would work, too); strong grasp of type
      inference specifications in the style of Damas-Milner/Cle&#769;ment et
      al. as
      explored <a href="/papers/2016/type-app/visible-type-app.pdf">here</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Visible type patterns</span>.
	Some <a href="/papers/2016/type-app/visible-type-app.pdf">
	recent work</a> has introduced type applications to Haskell. These
	type applications can be used only in expressions, never in patterns.
	Users are thus asking to extend the new feature to patterns, as
	tracked
	in <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/11350">this
	ticket</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/96">this
	proposal</a>. (Do also
	see <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/11638#comment:1">this
	comment</a>, which discusses some of the challenges.) This project
	would be to specify and implement the new feature, hopefully leading
	to a Haskell Symposium publication.</p>

      <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Experience with type-level and GADT
      programming in Haskell, and strong Haskell programming skills.</p> </li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Open data kinds</span>. It is sometimes
      necessary to define new datatypes not to store data, but to use as
      symbols in type-level computation. However, all datatype declarations
      must have a kind that ends in <tt>Type</tt>. This project is to design
      and implement a way of adding new open kinds to GHC. This feature
      request is tracked
      on <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/11080">this
      ticket</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Done well, this work could lead to a Haskell Symposium submission.</p>

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Experience with type-level programming in
    Haskell, and strong Haskell programming skills.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Rewriting <tt>deriving</tt> to use Template
      Haskell</span>. GHC's current <tt>deriving</tt> mechanism allows the
      compiler to write class instances on behalf of users. However, there is
      no way for users to extend this useful feature; instead, the
      way <tt>deriving</tt> works is baked into the compiler itself. This
      project would be to design and implement a
      user-extensible <tt>deriving</tt> mechanism via Template Haskell.</p>

    <p><em>Prequisites:</em> Strong Haskell programming skills.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Instance templates</span>. It is often the
      case that instances of several classes belong together. For example, you
      would never have an <tt>Ord</tt> instance for a class without
      an <tt>Eq</tt> instance. Even worse, it's possible to write
      the <tt>Eq</tt> instance directly from information in the <tt>Ord</tt>
      instance. Thus, writing the <tt>Eq</tt> instance is redundant. This
      project is to finish the design and implementation
      of <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/InstanceTemplates">instance
      templates</a>, a feature that would allow users to omit the <tt>Eq</tt>
      instance. A well-articulated discussion behind the design and
      implementation of this feature could make for an interesting Haskell
      Symposium submission.</p>

  <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> Strong Haskell programming skills.</p></li>

  <li><p><span class="projname">Other GHC development</span>. There's always
      lots of work to be done improving GHC. For
      example, <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals">this
      repo</a> and its pull requests track new features proposed for GHC. You
      could implement one! Or there are many bugs out there that need to be
      squashed; you might
      find <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Newcomers">this
      page</a> helpful.</p>

    <p>Do not consider this to be "just programming". Two minor GHC
      improvements that I started working on, thinking that the challenge was
      just some programming, lead
      to <a href="/papers/2014/axioms/axioms.pdf">two</a>
      <a href="/papers/2016/type-app/visible-type-app.pdf">papers</a>
      published in top venues. You never know where a problem will lead.</p>

    <p>Possible ideas (more notes to self than anything else):
      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/8177">#8177</a>: Roles for type families</li>
	<li>Untie the knot using <tt>TcTyCon</tt>. (Could relate to a new paper on kind inference for datatypes.)</li>
	<li><a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/11307">#11307</a> might be a good warmup. It's a straightforward AST refactoring.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/goldfirere/singletons/issues/113">singletons#113</a> involves some
	  performance exploration in a library I maintain. This would be a good warmup project in learning
	  about Haskell and dependent types.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

	  

    <p><em>Prerequisites:</em> A strong knowledge of the Haskell language,
    along with strong Haskell programming skills.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
