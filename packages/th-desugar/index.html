        <h1>The <tt>th-desugar</tt> library</h1>

        <p>This page is the home of the <tt>th-desugar</tt> library, maintained by <a href="../../index.html">Richard Eisenberg</a>. <tt>th-desugar</tt> provides functions to simplify the rich syntax allowed in Template Haskell into a more palatable (and smaller) form. See the <a href="haddock">documentation</a> to get an idea of the simpler forms that <tt>th-desugar</tt> produces.</p>

<p>A future extension will be to greatly simplify <tt>case</tt> statements, making it so that patterns do not overlap.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Download the <a href="th-desugar-1.0.0.tar.gz">tarball</a></li>
	    <li>Browse the <a href="th-desugar-1.0.0">sources</a></li>

        </ul>

<p>Known issue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unboxed things do not always work. This is because the processing sometimes
      puts them into tuples, which is not allowed. This will be fixed in a future
      release.</li>
</ul>
