<p>Here are my currently active projects, in no particular order. When no
collaborators are listed, it can be assumed
that <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie</a> has her hand in the
project.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="projname">Make Haskell dependently typed</span>. We propose an
update to FC, the internal language of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>, 
that brings kind equalities to the language. The new System FC merges types and kinds
and has the (*:*) axiom. The
<a href="papers/2013/fckinds/fckinds.pdf">paper</a>
(and <a href="papers/2013/fckinds/fckinds-extended.pdf">extended version</a>),
was published at ICFP 2013. I have <a href="packages/nokinds/">implemented</a> these ideas into
GHC. Ongoing work includes working out a type inference algorithm in order to
carry our changes from the internal language into Haskell.

<li><span class="projname">Roles in GHC</span>. I have implemented roles into GHC,
as released as part of GHC 7.8. <a href="papers/2014/coercible/coercible.pdf">Here</a>
is a draft paper, accepted to ICFP 2014, on the subject. (<a href="papers/2014/coercible/coercible-ext.pdf">extended version</a>) There continues to be ongoing debate about roles
and the best way forward with them, and I expect to implement whatever new features
are necessary.</li>

<li><span class="projname">singletons</span>. This project supports the
<a href="http://github.com/goldfirere/singletons">singletons</a> package, allowing
a limited form of dependently typed programming in current versions of Haskell. The
newest version of <tt>singletons</tt> supports the promotion of a wide array of term-level
functions to type families. See <a href="papers/2014/promotion/promotion.pdf">the draft
paper</a>. The original
<a href="papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf">paper</a> resulting from this work was published
at the Haskell Symposium, 2012. With Jan Stolarek.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are my less active projects. Most weeks do not involve any work on these,
but issues crop up now and again.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="projname">Roles</span>. I implemented a simplified version
of the ideas in <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/papers/popl163af-weirich.pdf">Generative type abstraction and type-level computation</a> into GHC. This prevents
the <pre>GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</pre> bug. See also the <a href="http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Roles">wiki page</a> on the subject. This work was completed while I was preforming an internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge, under the supervision of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/">Simon
Peyton Jones</a>.</li>
<li><span class="projname">units</span>. This is a library, written using closed
type families, that allows for type-level dimensional analysis, to aid programs
written using units-of-measure. The project page is <a href="packages/units/">here</a>.</li>
<li><span class="projname">Closed type families in
Haskell</span>. What changes are necessary to the surface language and in GHC
to allow closed type families with ordered, overlapping equations? See
the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/NewAxioms">GHC wiki
page</a> for more info. This feature is now part of GHC and will be included
in the next major release. We have also submitted a <a href="papers/2014/axioms/axioms.pdf">paper</a> (<a href="papers/2014/axioms/axioms-extended.pdf">extended version</a>, with
proofs and further examples) to POPL 2014.

Weirich</a>.</li>
<li><span class="projname">System FC in GHC</span>. I maintain a formal specification
of the internal language within GHC <a href="https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/master/docs/core-spec/core-spec.pdf?raw=true">here</a>.</li>
<li><span class="projname">Ironclad C++</span>. We define a subset of C++ that
can be proved not to allow access to invalid memory locations. Our paper
will be presented at OOPSLA 2013. <a href="papers/2013/ironclad/tr.pdf">Here</a>
is the accompanying technical report, with the proof of the critical pointer-lifetime
invariant.
