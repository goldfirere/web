<p>In addition to what you see below, check out my <a href="https://github.com/goldfirere">GitHub page</a> to
see what I've been working on recently.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="projname">Make Haskell dependently typed</span>. We propose an
update to FC, the internal language of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>,
that brings kind equalities to the language. The new System FC merges types and kinds
and has the <tt>(*:*)</tt> axiom. The
<a href="papers/2013/fckinds/fckinds.pdf">paper</a>
(and <a href="papers/2013/fckinds/fckinds-extended.pdf">extended version</a>),
was published at ICFP 2013. I have implemented these ideas into
GHC 8.0. (<a href="papers/2015/equalities/equalities.pdf">Here</a> is an unpublished paper
about the implementation.) Ongoing work includes adding proper Pi-types, as described in
my <a href="papers/2016/thesis/eisenberg-thesis.pdf">dissertation</a>.</li>
<li><span class="projname">GHC Maintenance</span>. As one of the core developers
  of GHC, I often perform routine maintenance. I am also currently the Template
  Haskell czar, overseeing the continued growth of that component of GHC. I have
  implemented or have had a large hand in implementing the following GHC features:
  <ul>
    <li>Levity polymorphism</li>
    <li>Template Haskell updates since 2012</li>
    <li>Closed type families</li>
    <li>Roles and <tt>Coercible</tt></li>
    <li>Injective type families</li>
    <li>Visible type application</li>
    <li>The <tt>Data.Type</tt> modules in the standard library</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Below are my less active projects. Most weeks do not involve any work on these,
but issues crop up now and again.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="projname">singletons</span>. This project supports the
<a href="http://github.com/goldfirere/singletons">singletons</a> package, allowing
a limited form of dependently typed programming in current versions of Haskell. The
newest version of <tt>singletons</tt> supports the promotion of a wide array of term-level
functions to type families. See <a href="papers/2014/promotion/promotion.pdf">the
paper</a>, published at Haskell Symposium, 2014. The original
<a href="papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf">paper</a> resulting from this work was published
at the Haskell Symposium, 2012. With Jan Stolarek.</li>
<li><span class="projname">glambda</span>. <a href="https://github.com/goldfirere/glambda">Glambda</a> is a lambda-calculus interpreter,
  written using GADTs extensively. It is meant as a larger case study of how
  GADTs can be used to make real, running code safer to run and easier to write.</li>
<li><span class="projname">Roles</span>. I implemented <em>roles</em>,
  as described in our <a href="papers/2014/coercible/coercible.pdf">ICFP'14 paper</a> and our draft JFP <a href="papers/2015/coercible-jfp/coercible-jfp.pdf">submission</a>, into GHC.
This prevents
the <tt>GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</tt> bug, as described <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1496">here</a>. See also the <a href="http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Roles">wiki page</a> on the subject. This work was completed while I was preforming an internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge, under the supervision of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/">Simon
Peyton Jones</a>.</li>
<li><span class="projname">units</span>. This is a library, written using closed
type families, that allows for type-level dimensional analysis, to aid programs
  written using units-of-measure. The most detailed description of this project
  is in an <a href="papers/2014/units/units.pdf">experience report</a>
  published at Haskell Symposium 2014.
  The project page is <a href="https://github.com/goldfirere/units">here</a>.
  With Takayuki Muranushi.</li>
<li><span class="projname">Closed type families in
Haskell</span>. What changes are necessary to the surface language and in GHC
to allow closed type families with ordered, overlapping equations? See
  the <a href="papers/2014/axioms/axioms.pdf">paper</a> (published at POPL'14)
  and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/NewAxioms">GHC wiki
page</a> for more info. This feature is part of GHC 7.8 and above.

Vytiniotis</a>,
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/">Simon
Peyton Jones</a>, and <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie
Weirich</a>.</li>
<li><span class="projname">System FC in GHC</span>. I maintain a formal specification
of the internal language within GHC <a href="https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/master/docs/core-spec/core-spec.pdf?raw=true">here</a>.</li>
